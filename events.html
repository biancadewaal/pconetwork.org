      <p style="font-weight: bold">Lunch Session - February 2024 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In February 2024, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) hosted a lunch session that marked an important step toward the need for global collaboration on port call optimization. The discussion highlighted critical challenges such as fragmented data standards, inconsistent operational practices, and the need for harmonized approaches to Just-in-Time arrival. Participants agreed on the urgency to align nautical, operational, and administrative data standards to improve efficiency, safety, and sustainability across ports worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This session laid the foundation for the creation of the Port Call Optimization (PCO) Network—a global initiative designed to accelerate the adoption and harmonization of standards and solutions. The network brings together ports, shipping lines, and industry partners to reduce emissions, shorten waiting times, and enhance operational efficiency through better coordination and shared guidance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">PCO Network Meeting 2024 in Rotterdam&nbsp;</p>
      <p>From 26–27 June 2024, the Port of Rotterdam hosted the first Port Call Optimization (PCO) Network workshop initiated by the International Taskforce Port Call Optimization and Green Digital Shipping Corridor. The event brought together key global stakeholders and expert groups to exchange insights on challenges to Port Call Optimization and Just-in-Time arrival, and to foster collaboration across seven major initiatives: chainPORT, Green Digital Shipping Corridor, Global Maritime Forum, IMO GreenVoyage2050 Low Carbon Global Industry Alliance, International Taskforce Port Call Optimization, MISSION Project, and DYNAPORT.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Over two days of dynamic discussions, participants worked on common action points to enhance port call performance worldwide, driving progress toward more efficient and sustainable maritime operations. Our shared mission is to accelerate the adoption and harmonization of global standards and solutions for nautical, operational, and administrative data in the global network of ports.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>PCO Network Meeting 2025 in Valencia&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p> From 26-28, 2025, the Port of Valencia hosted the second annual plenary meeting of the Port Call Optimization (PCO) Network, organized by the Valenciaport Foundation, the Port of Rotterdam, and the Horizon Europe projects MISSION and DYNAPORT.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Bringing together over 90 global maritime leaders, the event advanced efforts to harmonize standards and digital solutions for smarter, more efficient port calls. The PCO Network is developing the Port Call Optimization Guide to support ports and shipping lines in reducing emissions by up to 15% through better coordination, shorter waiting times, and improved operational efficiency across the sector.&nbsp;</p>
