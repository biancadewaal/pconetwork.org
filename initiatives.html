      <li><strong><a href="https://dynaport.eu/" target="_blank">DYNAPORT</a></strong>: Navigation and Port call Optimisation&nbsp;</li><br>
	<p>- Objective: DYNAPORT aims to develop new optimization and coordination tools for ports and ships, targeting a reduction in fuel consumption by at least 10% and an increase in port efficiency. This comprehensive objective involves: Developing improvements in port call processes to enable efficient information sharing and provide a blueprint for standardized operations. Providing a voyage optimization tool integrated into cooperative port call processes to enhance voyage and port call efficiency. Enhancing nautical safety by integrating nautical information and vessel traffic services (VTS) into port arrival and departure processes. Investigating business models and contracts in ports and shipping to facilitate better cooperation and just-in-time (JIT) arrivals. Establishing communication standards between ship and port parties for agreed departure and arrival times. Developing cyber-secure communication solutions for trusted information exchange. Measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of DYNAPORT's improvements through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Developing business plans for scaling up the implementation of DYNAPORT solutions.</p> </li><br>
      <li><strong><a href="https://missionproject.eu/" target="blank"> Mission</a></strong>: Just in time optimization&nbsp;</li><br>
     <p>- Objective: The goal of the MISSION project is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the shipping industry by up to 23% on the overall voyage and port call, including shore side activities, through the integration of existing systems to enable efficient communication and optimization of port calls. Integrate existing (software) system for the shipping industry to facilitate communication and coordination between ships and ports. Ultimately reducing fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions by optimizing port call processes and reducing waiting times. Bridge the gap between academia, research organizations, and the maritime industry to foster collaboration and innovation in addressing environmental challenges.</p></li><br>

      <li><strong><a href="https://www.iaphworldports.org/" target="_blank">IAPH</a></strong>: Global collaboration for cleaner ports&nbsp;<br>
        <p>- Objective: Strengthen relationships among the member ports by facilitating interaction, dialogue, problem-solving and sharing or formulation of best practices. Leverage member expertise through strong technical committees and programs that create platforms focused on resolving complex port and maritime industry concerns and build greater efficiency and sustainability for ports worldwide. Promote and demonstrate IAPH members’ leadership and commitment to a cleaner, safer and more environmentally sustainable industry for the benefit of the global community. Proactively coordinate with other international maritime and related organizations (such as IMO, UNCTAD, ECOSOC, ILO, WCO, UNEP, etc.) and advocate for global solutions to issues that impact IAPH members.</p></li><br>
      <li><strong><a href="https://portcalloptimization.org/" target="_blank">ITPCO</a></strong>: Port Call Optimization framework&nbsp;<br>
        <p>- Objective: To reduce and optimize vessel berth time at ports by improving the quality and availability of nautical, administrative, and operational data exchange. To create a framework where all solutions can work effectively alongside one another, without endorsing any specific software, hardware, or instrument system. Enhance the quality and availability of global nautical data to ensure vessel-berth compatibility and safe navigation. Improve the exchange of mandatory data between ship and shore authorities to reduce administrative burden and optimize port stays.</p></li><br>
      <li><strong><a href="https://greenvoyage2050.imo.org/about-the-gia/" target="_blank">IMO GIA</a></strong>: GreenVoyage 2050 capacity building&nbsp;<br>
        <p>- Objective: Improving the policy and regulatory environments; Knowledge/informational and human capacity developments; Institutional capacity building; Activities undertaken by the Alliance include research and development, showcasing technology advancements, facilitating industry dialogue, and implementing capacity-building and information exchange activities. To identify and develop innovative solutions to address common barriers to the uptake and implementation of energy efficiency technologies and operational measures in the maritime industry. To promote collaboration among maritime industry leaders, including shipowners, operators, classification societies, engine and technology builders, big data providers, oil companies, and ports.</p></li><br>
      <li><strong><a href="https://globalmaritimeforum.org/" target="_blank">Global Maritime Forum</a></strong>: Efficiency as decarbonisation prerequisite&nbsp;<br>
        <p>- Objective: Promote operational efficiency as a decarbonisation prerequisite through sharing of best practices. Engaging stakeholders with the goal of transitioning from ambition to action. Run pilot projects that showcase efficiency measures, e.g. just in time arrival.</p></li><br>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2024/me/news/greener-port-calls-on-the-horizon-nwo-grants-4-million-euro-project/" target="_blank"> PortCall.Zero</a></strong>: AI-driven port call decarbonization&nbsp;<br>
        <p>- Objective: Develop novel AI methods with federated, prescriptive and data mash concepts to realize decarbonized port calls. Address data sharing needs and limitations through federated AI and data mashes, considering stakeholders' perspectives and the point that not all information is available centrally. Create new approaches to combine prediction models and decision support modelling for decarbonized port calls. Establish advanced models to evaluate port call changes induced by new net zero technology (shore power and alternative fuels). Perform a novel environmental analysis for the collaborative port call process highlighting the different roles of involved parties. Develop a virtual port call environment that demonstrates the effects of the developed methods.</p></li><br>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.mpa.gov.sg/maritime-singapore/port-authorities-roundtable/" target="_blank">Port Authority Round Table</a></strong>: Strengthen cooperation among port authorities&nbsp;<br>
        <p>- Objective: The primary goal of the PAR is to strengthen consensus and cooperation among port authorities. The objective is to facilitate the exchange of best practices, enhance collaboration, and address common challenges in the maritime industry.</p></li>
