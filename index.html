        <h1>Welcome at the PCO Network:</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p> We provide essential guidance to optimize voyages from port to port and berth to berth, establishing a comprehensive global network of connected ports, terminals and ships. This saves time, reduces emissions, and lowers costs, benefiting all stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>WHO WE ARE&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>The network encompasses a wide array of ports, terminals, shipping lines, associated nautical and ship services, and project consortia.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>WHAT WE DO&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>Our common mission is to accelerate the adoption and harmonization of global standards and solutions for nautical, operational and administrative data in the global network of ports. The benefits are substantial. It will: - reduce ship emissions en route, in and around ports, terminals and port cities; - ensure greater safety and compliance, promote cleaner environment; - lower costs for shipping lines, shippers, terminals and ports. This represents a targeted yet considerable advancement towards enhancing the sustainability of shipping. While we are not a formal organisation, coordinating efforts through this global network significantly improves the feasibility and effectiveness of our scope.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>A DATA-DRIVEN FRAMEWORK&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>The data scope is based on a port and trade agnostic port call process, with a foundation in IMO regulations and BIMCO contracts. The data sharing is established through existing technologies and trade practices, ensuring that existing chains of command and contractual relationships between commercial parties remain untouched. We are working on harmonizing three core data domains based on robust standardization bodies respected by both ports and shipping stakeholders. </p>
