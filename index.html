       Port Call Optimization (PCO) is our approach to improving maritime efficiency through smarter coordination of port calls. We provide essential guidance to optimize voyages from port to port and berth to berth, creating a comprehensive global network of connected ports, terminals, and ships. This saves time, reduces emissions, and lowers costs, benefiting all stakeholders. 
		<p>&nbsp;</p> 
		<P><strong> Who We Are</strong></P> 
		
		Our network brings together a diverse range of ports, terminals, shipping lines, nautical and ship services, and project consortia. 
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>What We Do</strong></p> 
		
		Our shared mission is to accelerate the adoption and harmonization of global standards and solutions for nautical, operational, and administrative data across the global network of ports. 
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>The benefits are substantail&nbsp;</strong></p>
		<p><ul>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>* Reduced ship emissions en route, in and around ports, terminals, and port cities&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>* Greater safety and compliance, promoting a cleaner environment&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>* Lower operational costs for shipping lines, shippers, terminals, and ports</p>
		  </blockquote>
        &nbsp;
          <p>This represents a focused yet significant step toward advancing the sustainability of global shipping. While we are not a formal organization, coordinating efforts through this global network greatly enhances the feasibility and effectiveness of our collective goals.</p>
        </ul>
		&nbsp;
      <p><strong> A Data-Driven Framework</strong></p> 
		Our data framework is built on a port- and trade-agnostic port call process, grounded in IMO regulations and BIMCO contracts. Data sharing relies on existing technologies and trade practices, ensuring that current chains of command and contractual relationships between commercial parties remain intact. We are working to harmonize three core data domains based on robust standardization frameworks that are respected and adopted by both ports and shipping stakeholders.
